    "text": "Who can / should take this course?\nThis is a fast-paced and demanding course designed to prepare PhD students for research careers in statistics. Undergraduates and PhD students in other fields are very welcome to take the class, and many have succeeded in the past. But you should be prepared to work hard.\nCan I take this course if I have a conflict with the lecture time?\nAttendance is not taken at lectures but attending is an important part of taking the course. If you want to take another course at the same time, you can do it as long as the other professor is OK with your not attending their lectures.\nHow can I prepare for the course?\nThe course prerequisites are undergraduate-level linear algebra, real analysis, and a year of upper-division probability and statistics. If you are unsure of your background in one or more of these, the texts below can be useful review materials. All books linked below, except Gelman & Hill, should be available for free with a Berkeley library subscription. Email me if you have trouble accessing them.\n\nLinear algebra: Fluency with undergrad-level abstract linear algebra is essential to understanding the course content (numerical tools like LU or Cholesky decompositions are not essential). Chapters 1-3 and 5-6 of Linear Algebra Done Right (Axler) are good review materials.\nReal analysis: Familiarity with and intuition for ideas of infinite sequences, convergence, Taylor approximations, etc. should be enough. Chapters 1-3 of Understanding Analysis (Abbott) are good review materials.\nProbability: The whole course involves probability. If Chapters 1-6, 8-9, 13-17, and 23 of Probability for Data Science (Adhikari and Pitman) aren’t mostly review for you, I strongly recommend studying them before the course begins.\nStatistics: We will derive all statistical results from first principles, but at a fairly technical level. If you have never seen them in an applied context, Chapters 1-6 of Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman & Hill) should give you some frame of reference."

    "section": "About Stat 210A",
    "text": "About Stat 210A\n\nWhat is the theory of statistics?\nStatistics is the study of methods that use data to understand the world. Statistical methods are used throughout the natural and social sciences, in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and in engineering. Despite the ubiquitous use of statistics, its practitioners are perpetually accused of not actually understanding what they are doing. Statistics theory is, broadly speaking, the subject of what exactly we are doing when we apply statistical methods.\nWhile there are many possible ways to analyze data, most (but certainly not all) statistical methods are based on statistical modeling: treating the data as a realization of some random data-generating process with attributes, usually called parameters, that are a priori unknown. The goal of the analyst, then, is to use the data to draw accurate inferences about these parameters and/or to make accurate predictions about future data. If the modeling has been done well (a very big “if”) then these unknown parameters will correspond well to whatever real-world questions initially motivated the analysis. Applied statistics courses like Stat 215A and B delve deeply into questions about how to ensure that the statistical modeling exercise successfully captures something interesting about reality.\nIn this course we will instead focus on how the analyst can use the data most effectively within the context of a given mathematical setup. We will discuss the structure of statistical models, how to evaluate the quality of a statistical method, how to design good methods for new settings, and the philosophy of Bayesian vs frequentist modeling frameworks. We will cover estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing, in parametric and nonparametric methods, in finite samples and asymptotic regimes.\n\n\nTopics\nStatistical decision theory (frequentist and Bayesian), exponential families, point estimation, hypothesis testing, resampling methods, estimating equations and maximum likelihood, empirical Bayes, large-sample theory, high-dimensional testing, multiple testing and selective inference.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThe course prerequisites are linear algebra, analysis, probability, and statistics.\n\n\nRelationship of Stat 210A to other Berkeley courses\nStat 210A focuses on classical statistical contexts: either inference in finite samples, or in fixed-dimensional asymptotic regimes. Stat 210B (for which 210A is a prerequisite) is more technical and covers topics like empirical process theory and high-dimensional statistics.\nBerkeley’s graduate course on Statistical Learning Theory (CS 281A / Stat 241A) is also very popular and has some overlap in its topics. Roughly speaking, it is more tilted toward “machine learning”: it spends more time on topics in predictive modeling (i.e. classification and regression, which are covered in Stat 215A), optimization, and signal processing, but spends less time on inferential questions and (I believe) does not cover topics like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and causal inference. Both courses cover estimation and exponential families."
